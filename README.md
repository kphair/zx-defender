# zx-defender

Spectrum version of Defender

These sources are designed to be assembled using Design Design's ZEUS assembler. Just assemble defender.asm (from the command line, "zcl defender.asm") and it will pull it all the necessary source files to complete the build.

This is still very much a work in progress while I work on disassembling the original Defender ROMs so no guarantees are made that I will even be able to finish this. Let's just say that I intend to complete it and have it playable as Defender is probably my all-time favourite arcade game.
