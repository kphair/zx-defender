# zx-defender

Spectrum version of Defender

These sources are designed to be assembled using Design Design's ZEUS assembler. Just assemble defender.asm (from the command line, "zcl defender.asm") and it will pull it all the necessary source files to complete the build.

There are two options for the output generated by the build:
  * An SZX file for loading into an emulator
  * A tape file for loading into an emulator, loading into a real machine by tape/HDD/memory card/network etc.
Just set the snapshot flag at the very beginning to determine the outcome.

This is still very much a work in progress while I work on disassembling the original Defender ROMs so no guarantees are made that I will even be able to finish this. Let's just say that I intend to complete it and have it playable as Defender is probably my all-time favourite arcade game.

The following is a list of current source files and a rough description of their function

 charset.asm          The character set used by the game
 
	defender.asm         The main game loop and initialisation code
	
	fx.asm               General special effects
	
	input.asm            User input handling
	
	landscape.asm        Drawing and erasing the scrolling landscape
	
	screen.asm           General purpose display-related subroutines
	
	sprite_code.asm      Code for managing sprites
	
	sprite_data.asm      Graphic data for the sprites
	
	sprite_macro.asm     Macros used by the sprite management code
	
	tables.asm           Lookup tables for screen address translation and other stuff
	
	vars.asm             Most of the variables used by the code
	
	view.asm             Camera management routines to handle the panning and inertia effects
